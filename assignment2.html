        <h1>RAMSEY LOANED TO RANGERS</h1>
        <h2>31 JANUARY 2022</h2>
        <p>Aaron Ramsey has left Juventus. The midfielder will play the remainder of the season on loan at Rangers in the Scottish Premiership.

            The Welsh midfielder made 70 appearances for the Bianconeri since arriving from Arsenal in 2019. He scored six goals, including one in the Champions League, in the away match at Lokomotiv Moscow, and five in Serie A against Verona, SPAL and Inter, Sassuolo and Sampdoria. Arguably the most precious was his strike against Inter, in the Allianz Stadium that was empty for the first time. His performance was capped off with the assist for Paulo Dybala's splendid goal in the 2-0 victory.
            
            But above all, he contributed to the Bianconeri’s recent trophy haul, winning a league title, the ninth consecutive Serie A crown for Juventus, an Italian Super Cup and an Italian Cup. 
            
             Thanks for everything and good luck Aaron!</p>

        <h1>OFFICIAL | ZAKARIA JOINS JUVENTUS!</h1>
        <h2>31 JANUARY 2022</h2>
        <p>Denis Zakaria is a Juventus player. The Swiss midfielder, 25, has signed for Juventus, and leaves the Bundesliga after 125 appearances with Borussia Mönchengladbach. Born on 20 November 1996 in Geneva, Zakaria began his football career with Servette. At his local club, he made his professional debut and also scored his first goal, before moving to Young Boys. After two seasons with the club from Berne he left Switzerland for Germany.

            For four and a half seasons, Denis put his qualities at the service of Borussia Mönchengladbach, making a total of 125 appearances - the second youngest player to reach that benchmark in the German top flight - and scoring 11 goals. Stats that highlight how he became central to the Mönchengladbach midfield.
            
            Evidence of his consistency and reliability is that Zakaria is one of the three Borussia Mönchengladbach players to have scored in each of the last 5 seasons in the league and one of the three Bundesliga midfielders this campaign to have completed at least 90% of their passes.
            
            Such performances on the domestic front have also been recognised at an international level, with 40 caps and three goals with Switzerland.
            
            Explosive, dynamic and gifted with a highly-tuned tactical awareness, Denis is now preparing for the most stimulating and special of adventures, in the shirt of the Bianconeri.
            
            Welcome, Zak!</p>
